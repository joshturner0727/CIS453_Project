This is my final project for CIS453 lab. The aim of the website is to be a simple introduction
to the loacl cuisine of my hometown, Manassas, Virginia. It is a simple three page site
that incorporates single page navigation and custom components using react. I think that
in the long run a website like this could be expanded and become a useful tool for people who 
are new to the area. For now this is a simple concept to serve as a reference to work off of 
in the future. I hope you enjoy! In order to load the site on a local host just follow the instructions 
provided in the default Read Me file that explains how to get react up and running. Thank you for 
visiting!
